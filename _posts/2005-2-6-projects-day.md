Sunday is projects day! So to spurn the upsettedness over TWIG, I committed some more work on TWIG3 -- it's been almost 8 months since my last commit. Shoot. One day TWIG3 will happen and it'll be awesome. Over on the DBMail front, I fixed a bug. Er, used someone else's fix to yet another person's well-researched bug. So basically I just typed a few things into CVS. But that's my responsibility just as much as fixing bugs myself. Good work without too much hassle. A job well done :-) And on the co-op-front, I need to finish up some attic wiring before the garage-dwellers string me up by my ankles.
