I didn't end up reading any books. Instead I've been sleeping much more than usual, my finger is driving me up a wall, I've had non-stop meetings every night and days now, too, and that's taking quite a toll. The hurry-up-and-wait of a 1 hour meeting is like 3 hours out of my day to prep for, participate in, and recover from each meeting.

I took the bandage off my finger for the evening to let it air out a bit and get some feeling back in my fingertip. It's going to get bandaged up again before bedtime because it's still basically an open wound. I suppose if I weren't so tired, I'd be more interested in all of the layers of skin I get to see now. Bah.
