Why, when I was a kid, we had to write code while walking 20 miles to the
computer building, in 12 feet of snow in the middle of winter. And it was
uphill both ways! Course we couldn't wear gloves, because it was too hard to
line up the hole punch on the punched card. They didn't have knapsacks in those
days, so we just had to keep our card stack on a string tied to our belt. Now,
a hole punch cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of
bumblebees on 'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say. Now where were
we? Oh yeah, the important thing was I had a stack of punch cards on my belt,
was the style at the time. They didn't have standard 5081 cards in stock,
because of the war. The only thing you could get was graph papyrus, and you had
to draw all the tables by hand.
