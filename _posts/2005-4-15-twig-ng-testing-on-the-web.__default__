My work on TWIG NG is now up on the TWIG website. The URL is secret for the time being, just in case my new security model breaks or I left any crufty code that would sink it. But it's exciting to have it up, even if it is just for a few people right now!

On the DBMail side, looks like there's a critical mass of bugs now. Time to get cracking on them and heading to another release...
