Ok, here's the new wishlist item: <a title="ThinkPad X60s" href="http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=4611686018425155327&#038;catalogId=-840">ThinkPad X60s</a>

Cash in hand: $400. More to raise: $1400.

I wish I could go for something cheaper, but the battery life on this thing, especially with the extra battery pack, is just amazing. Two models ago, when new, I got an honest 8 hours. After a year and a half, it has died down to 5 hours. This new model has the same size batteries, and lower power consumption on the hard drive and CPU. The reviews have been awesome, just as they were with my poor old laptop :-|
