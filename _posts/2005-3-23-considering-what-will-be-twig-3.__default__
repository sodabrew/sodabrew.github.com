So now there's an alternate proposal for TWIG 3. It's much less ambitious, and completely based on improvements from the current codebase rather than my work so far. Sort of annoying. But there's an upside to this, and it's that I may be able to convince everyone else of the dire need for good UI's in TWIG for first-time install, setup, ongoing configuration, and first-time user logins. Frankly, if we can tackle all of that then I'll be happy calling it TWIG 3.
