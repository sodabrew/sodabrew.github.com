The Dilburn campers jotted some useful notes on a little whiteboard at our camp. Eventually I wanted to erase the whiteboard, so here's what it said!

<ul>
	<li>Burning Man is what you make it.</li>
	<li>RVs are really nice.</li>
	<li>Art cars are fun!</li>
	<li>Hexayurts are the way of the future.</li>
	<li>Tents are dusty.</li>
	<li>White carports don't reflect enough sun.</li>
	<li>Bring extra rebar and sledgehammers. Not just extra. Bring too much.</li>
	<li>Coffee.</li>
	<li>Couches.</li>
	<li>NO PACKAGING!</li>
	<li>Repack everything into bins, sorted by type-of-thing.</li>
	<li>Bring power tools. Charged.</li>
	<li>Try camping on the 7:30 side. It's crowded, and different than the 4:30 side.</li>
	<li>Create wind and sun breaks.</li>
	<li>Designate a shit table.</li>
	<li>Give foot baths.</li>
	<li>Drinks are communal. Expect your beer cooler to be raided, so just have everyone pay in upfront.</li>
	<li>There's no such thing as a quick trip at Burning Man - never say, "I'll be right back!"</li>
</ul>
