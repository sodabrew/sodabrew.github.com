And thenceforth a fortnight later the bugs were done or passed along. Big
relief. Can't wait for the next releases! I need to kick some butt on my
computer science homework this weekend. It's almost mind numbing, because the
instructor wants things done in just such a way, and worse yet, on tests, won't
accept any form of written explanation. Code or die. On paper. This must make
sense to people who come to these classes with their own experience and
knowledge in square one, but mine's not. I hate coding real C on paper. Where
they ding you for all sorts of stupid syntactic and even sylistic conventions.
Dude, it's paper. Not paper tape, not punchcards, but pencil and paper. I code
in vim.
