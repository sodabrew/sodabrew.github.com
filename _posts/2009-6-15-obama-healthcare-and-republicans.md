From this AP story on <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090616/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_obama_doctors">Obama pressing doctors to back health care overhaul</a>:

<blockquote>
GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia -- a former orthopedic surgeon -- reacted preemptively to Obama's speech by accusing him of seeking a "government takeover" of health care. Speaking to reporters on a conference call organized by the Republican National Committee, Price said a committee that Obama's administration has established to study the effectiveness of various medical treatments would turn into a "rationing board" to overrule doctors and deny patients care. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and other Republicans introduced legislation to ban the rationing of care on such a basis.</blockquote>

<em>Hello, pot? Yeah, this is kettle. You're black! </em>If these guys are going to draft legislation that prevents all insurance companies from denying coverage, awesome. If they allow private insurers to cut coverage but not a future public insurance, that's just one more scummy way that Republicans write laws specifically to doom government agencies to fail, then rail against those same agencies saying they shouldn't exist.
