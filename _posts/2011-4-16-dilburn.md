Burners can wander our office cubicle maze in search of more meaningful paths.
Your first job in cubitraz that may not have met your dreams. Take back your
dream! Our wide ties, blue blazers, and black rimmed glasses will teleport you

driver, sunbath coordinator, daydream distributor, professional shusher --
shhh, we're trying to work here!

Relax to our muzak and let our inspirational posters boost your productivity by
the minute. Be sure to stop by for the office mixer! This is not your daddy's
cube farm!

### Layout description:
The office portion of the camp will open to the road. This is the theme camp /
interactive space; a cubicle farm and maze under a 25' to 30' shade structure.
Behind the cubicles, vehicles will be used as a perimeter and personal tents
arranged inside. Approximately 10 personal tents and smaller shades are
expected. Shared spaces will include a 20' diameter shade structure, 10'x20'
carport cooking and eating space, evaporation device, shower bag structure, and
various comfy camping chairs. We will attempt to use solar power, and may
supplement with a small Honda-type generator.
