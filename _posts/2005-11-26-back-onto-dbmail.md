Been a while since I was last hacking actively on DBMail, but I'm back! Thanks much to a development bounty that's motivating me, and thanks to generally clearing my schedule of some useless junk . I also rather ought to use this blog more. The two things I've been working on now for DBMail are:

  * Loadable modules for database drivers, <em>because I'm sick of recompiling between MySQL and PostgreSQL.</em>
  * Sieve support and integration, <em>because it's been on the back burner for almost two years, and a fellow on the DBMail list offered me $1000 to finish it!</em>
