Ikea has at least half a dozen options for wine storage, but its Gorm shelf
system takes the cake for versatility. The Gorm is made of solid, unfinished
pine, allowing you to hack it more easily than Ikea products made of cardboard,
<strike>spit shine</strike> veneer, and plastic cams. Gorms can stand alone, be
chained together, mixed-and-matched with any part in the series, and, because
of its simple, solid wood construction, sawed, drilled, screwed, painted, or
stained to your heart's content.

For this hack, I started with a [Gorm 30"w x 13"d x 68"h kit](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30058508),
using three of the four shelves, and mixed in three more [Gorm wine rack shelves](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10058514).
Before I left Ikea, I went over to the parts department and got eight more screws to match the ones that hold the backstays onto the Gorm.

I picked up two [chrome wine glass racks](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=14914927)
and a [dozen wine glasses](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=103162&RN=59)
from Bed, Bath & Beyond, screwed the racks to the underside of
the top Gorm shelf (with those extra screws from Ikea), and voil√†, my very own
wine bar!

<em>Gorm assembly hint: get a 10mm socket for your drill-driver.</em>
