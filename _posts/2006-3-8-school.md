As of November 2006, I will be available for full-time employment. I am primarily interested in communications and email software development, focusing on backend network services and database storage. But anything fun and challenging will do the trick.

In the interim, I have taken on several small businesses and individuals as clients for network operations and office computer maintenance services on a monthly basis. I have found this small-scale work to fun and rewarding, building positive references and networking with potential dream-job employers.
