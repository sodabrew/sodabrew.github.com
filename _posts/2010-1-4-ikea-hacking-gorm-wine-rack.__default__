<div class="aside"><em>Gorm assembly hint: get a 10mm socket for your drill-driver.</em><a href="http://amzn.com/B000T9U9JE"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31G0beqf%2BML._SL500_SS75_.jpg" alt="10mm nut driver bit" class="right" /></a></div>

Ikea has at least half a dozen options for wine storage, but its Gorm shelf system takes the cake for versatility. The Gorm is made of solid, unfinished pine, allowing you to hack it more easily than Ikea products made of cardboard, <strike>spit shine</strike> veneer, and plastic cams. Gorms can stand alone, be chained together, mixed-and-matched with any part in the series, and, because of its simple, solid wood construction, sawed, drilled, screwed, painted, or stained to your heart's content.

Before I left Ikea, I went over to the parts department and got eight more screws to match the ones that hold the backstays onto the Gorm.
