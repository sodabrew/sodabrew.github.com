It took nearly 3 weeks, but my finger's 100% back up to speed now, there's just a bunch of redness around the wound site. I'm putting up a wishlist on my main page. I realized that there's a bunch of tech stuff I'd like and keep re-researching everytime I think about it. Very silly. I'm making a list.
