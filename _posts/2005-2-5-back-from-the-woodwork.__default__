This week a former maintainer of TWIG came out of the woodwork to complain about some of the changes in TWIG 2.8.1. It was entirely out of the blue, and although he posted well to the mailing list and seemed to ask for input from the current maintainer group, he also dug up his old CVS account and started throwing things into CVS according to his preferences. I am more than a little bit dismayed. One simply does not "look up my old password" three years later and start changing things just because, three years ago, he used to run the project. Most of his code has been good, and had he at least had the courtesy to ask if anyone would mind him going straight to CVS I wouldn't be so peeved. But he didn't, and thus I am quite peeved.
