I was going to go camping this weekend, but while packing up the trunk of the
car discovered a wonderful razor edge on the decorative chrome trim of the 2004
Jetta. My right ring finger has a giant gash along the topside. Programming is
probably not going to be happening this week at all, due to lack of
curly-brace-button-pushing-fingers. Grumble. I may actually have to relax and
read a book!
