The title is quite a mouthful, and so are these cookies! Crunchy, soft,
crumbly, textured, tasty, and as it happens, vegan and parve! I made this
recipe up last weekend while it was raining in San Francisco, and had a
hankering for cookies. Ate a bunch, and brought the rest in to work to share
and meet my coworkers. We all knew it was a rainy weekend, because the company
message board was full of "extra cookies in the break room!" messages :)

* 2/3 cup whole wheat flour
* 2/3 c. oatmeal
* 1/3 c. teff flour
* 1/2 c. sugar (white, demerara, brown, etc.)
* 1/3 c. olive oil
* 1/3 c. dark chocolate chips
* 2 tbsp. vanilla
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1 tsp. baking powder

Now you're probably looking through that list and thinking, "Ok, all that looks
familiar, except for that teff stuff. What's that!?" Teff is a grain grown in
Ethiopia. It's one of the most protein-dense grains, and also the smallest
whole grain. Ethiopians use it to make their native style of bread, called
<em>injera</em>, which I can best describe as a sourdough crÃªpe. Bob's Red Mill
sells [teff flour](http://www.bobsredmill.com/teff-flour.html),
available at most natural foods stores and Whole Foods.

Next time I make this recipe, I might also throw in some frozen concentrated
orange juice to add a little bit more binding to the finished batter. Eggs
would do the trick, too, but I didn't have any in the fridge when I whipped
this up.
