This new Google New York project at <a href="http://nycgo.com">nycgo.com</a>, using Google Maps and Earth with lots of local data is neat. But where it gets really incredible is the touchscreen interface that reminds me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a>. Specifically, I'm thinking about the large immersive gesture system that Tom Cruise uses to gather information about his situation.

Which is, of course, already something of a reality! Jeff Han <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html">demonstrated a large multitouch screen</a> with correspondingly incredible user interface at TED in 2006. Now Art Lebedev of Optimus Maximus keyboard fame is working on the <a href="http://www.etre.com/blog/2008/01/optimus_tactus_artemy_lebedev/">Optimus Tactus</a>, a concept keyboard where the keys are replaced with a touch screen, and the "keyboard" itself becomes reconfigurable to suit the application -- keys for typing, mixer controls for audio, video jogs and patches, and so on.
