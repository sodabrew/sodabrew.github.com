So I have this backup of a hard drive I sent in for RMA, and on that was a backup from my old laptop hard drive. Fortunately for me, the filesystem of the outer backup is corrupted to shit. I've been trying various combinations of e2retrieve, e2salvage, debugfs, and have had no luck. Another fellow on the e2salvage-devel mailing list referred me to this set of tools, <a href="http://dreamscape.org/toolkit/README.html">e2extract</a>. Wish me luck.
