I just bought an SSL certificate for this domain from Register.com. The price was great ($38 for 3 years! Just Google for "discount ssl certificate" to get a Register.com AdWord banner discount), the process went really smoothly, the certificate installed easily into Apache, and is working well for me so far.

In the middle of the process, while I was downloading the certs and reading their directions, I came across this doozy of a page. What Register.com is giving you are <b>static pictures of locks to make users feel safe</b>. In other words, <b>teaching people to trust the telltale signs of phishing tactics!</b> And I'm downright shocked at the favicon of a lock. That's a straight-up bald-faced attempt at making the site look like it's being seen by the browser as secured. Not cool!
