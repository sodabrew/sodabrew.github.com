I've been searching out the perfect wiki engine lately, and while I have been
lucky enough to have settled on [DokuWiki](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki)
because it's simple, pretty and works... except that it's really not all that
pretty once you try putting anything other than technical documentation into
it. I'm actually trying to run a whole website from within DokuWiki. It's
working very well, has reduced my webmaster duties a lot because I can hand out
user accounts and don't have to fiddle with repetitive HTML at all anymore...
but it's really pissing off the form-before-function people. So I've found
[WiClear](http://wiclear.free.fr/) which is <strong>really good
looking</strong> but has a pretty crappy wiki engine inside.

And so off to add templating to DokuWiki... 
[Bug #104](http://bugs.splitbrain.org/?do=details&amp;id=104).
